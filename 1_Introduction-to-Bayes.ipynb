      "As was noted above, Bayesian statistics involves using probability models to solve problems. So, the first task is to *completely specify* the model in terms of probability distributions. This includes everything: unknown parameters, data, covariates, missing data, predictions. All must be assigned some probability density.\n",

In fact, the difficulty inherent in calculating the posterior distribution for most models of interest is perhaps the major contributing factor for the lack of widespread adoption of Bayesian methods for data analysis. Various strategies for doing so comprise this tutorial.\n",

      "We already noted that there is just one estimator in Bayesian inference, which lends to its ***simplicity***.

      "## Bayes' Formula\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we have some probability under our belt, we turn to Bayes' formula. This, as you recall, is the engine that allows us to obtain estimates of unknown quantities that we care about, using information retained by the data we observe. It turns out to be quite simple to derive Bayes' formula directly from the definition of conditional probability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, the goal in Bayesian inference is to calcylate the **posterior distribution** of our unknowns:\n",
      "\n",
      "<div style=\"font-size: 150%;\">  \n",
      "\\\\[Pr(\\theta|Y=y)\\\\]\n",
      "</div>\n",
      "\n",
      "This expression is a **conditional probability**. It is the probability of \\\\(\\theta\\\\) *given* the observed values of \\\\(Y=y\\\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, the conditional probability of A given B is defined as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\\\[Pr(B|A) = \\frac{Pr(A \\cap B)}{Pr(A)}\\\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "To gain an intuition for this, it is helpful to use a Venn diagram:\n",
      "\n",
      "![conditional probability](images/conditional.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice from this diagram that the following conditional probability is also true:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\\\[Pr(A|B) = \\frac{Pr(A \\cap B)}{Pr(B)}\\\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "These can both be rearranged to be expressions of the joint probability of A and B. Setting these equal to one another:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\\\[Pr(B|A)Pr(A) = Pr(A|B)Pr(B)\\\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "Then rearranging:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\\\[Pr(B|A) = \\frac{Pr(A|B)Pr(B)}{Pr(A)}\\\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "This is Bayes' formula. Replacing the generic A and B with things we care about reveals why Bayes' formula is so important:\n",
      "\n",
      "![bayes formula](images/bayes_formula.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "The equation expresses how our belief about the value of \\\\(\\theta\\\\), as expressed by the **prior distribution** \\\\(P(\\theta)\\\\) is reallocated following the observation of the data \\\\(y\\\\), as expressed by the posterior distribution the posterior distribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "The innocuous denominator \\\\(P(y)\\\\) cannot be calculated directly, and is actually the expression in the numerator, integrated over all \\\\(\\theta\\\\):\n",
      "\n",
      "<div style=\"font-size: 150%;\">  \n",
      "\\\\[Pr(\\theta|y) = \\frac{Pr(y|\\theta)Pr(\\theta)}{\\int Pr(y|\\theta)Pr(\\theta) d\\theta}\\\\]\n",
      "</div>\n",
      "\n",
      "The intractability of this integral is one of the factors that has contributed to the under-utilization of Bayesian methods by statisticians.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Priors\n",
      "\n",
      "Once considered a controversial aspect of Bayesian analysis, the prior distribution characterizes what is known about an unknown quantity before observing the data from the present study. Thus, it represents the information state of that parameter. It can be used to reflect the information obtained in previous studies, to constrain the parameter to plausible values, or to represent the population of possible parameter values, of which the current study's parameter value can be considered a sample.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Likelihood functions\n",
      "\n",
      "The likelihood represents the information in the observed data, and is used to update prior distributions to posterior distributions. This updating of belief is justified becuase of the **likelihood principle**, which states:\n",
      "\n",
      "> Following observation of \\\\(y\\\\), the likelihood \\\\(L(\\theta|y)\\\\) contains all experimental information from \\\\(y\\\\) about the unknown \\\\(\\theta\\\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "Bayesian analysis satisfies the likelihood principle because the posterior distribution's dependence on the data is only through the likelihood. In comparison, most frequentist inference procedures violate the likelihood principle, because inference will depend on the design of the trial or experiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is a likelihood function? It is closely related to the probability density (or mass) function. Taking a common example, consider some data that are binomially distributed (that is, they describe the outcomes of \\\\(n\\\\) binary events). Here is the binomial sampling distribution:\n",
      "\n",

      "Let's put Bayesian inference into action using a very simple example. I've chosen this example because it is one of the rare occasions where the posterior can be calculated by hand. We will show how data can be used to update our belief in competing hypotheses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hemophilia is a rare genetic disorder that impairs the ability for the body's clotting factors to coagualate the blood in response to broken blood vessels. The disease is an **x-linked recessive** trait, meaning that there is only one copy of the gene in males but two in males, and the trait can be masked by the dominant allele of the gene. \n",
      "\n",
      "This implies that males with 1 gene are *affected*, while females with 1 gene are unaffected, but *carriers* of the disease. Having 2 copies of the disease is fatal, so this genotype does not exist in the population.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, consider a woman whose mother is a carrier (because her brother is affected) and who marries an unaffected man. Let's now observe some data: the woman has two consecutive (non-twin) sons who are unaffected. We are interested in determining **if the woman is a carrier**.\n",
      "\n",
      "![hemophilia](images/hemophilia.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "To set up this problem, we need to set up our probability model. The unknown quantity of interest is simply an indicator variable \\\\(W\\\\) that equals 1 if the woman is affected, and zero if she is not. We are interested in the probability that the variable equals one, given what we have observed:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\\\[Pr(W=1 | s_1=0, s_2=0)\\\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "Our prior information is based on what we know about the woman's ancestry: her mother was a carrier. Hence, the prior is \\\\(Pr(W=1) = 0.5\\\\). Another way of expressing this is in terms of the **prior odds**, or:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\\\[O(W=1) = \\frac{Pr(W=1)}{Pr(W=0)} = 1\\\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "Now for the likelihood: The form of this function is:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\\\[L(W | s_1=0, s_2=0)\\\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "This can be calculated as the probability of observing the data for any passed value for the parameter. For this simple problem, the likelihood takes only two possible values:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\\\[\\begin{aligned}\n",
      "L(W=1 &| s_1=0, s_2=0) = (0.5)(0.5) = 0.25 \\cr\n",
      "L(W=0 &| s_1=0, s_2=0) = (1)(1) = 1\n",
      "\\end{aligned}\\\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "With all the pieces in place, we can now apply Bayes' formula to calculate the posterior probability that the woman is a carrier:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\\\[\\begin{aligned}\n",
      "Pr(W=1 | s_1=0, s_2=0) &= \\frac{L(W=1 | s_1=0, s_2=0) Pr(W=1)}{L(W=1 | s_1=0, s_2=0) Pr(W=1) + L(W=0 | s_1=0, s_2=0) Pr(W=0)} \\cr\n",
